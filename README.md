# js-library-template

A template for writing next awesome JavaScript library.

## Features

- documentation generating with `jsdoc` with `docdash` template (may be replaced if something better comes in my way)
- unit tests with `mocha` & `must.js`
- es6+ first approach, with es5 transpiled version to be found inside `dist` folder *

\* - transpiling kills JS engines optimizations, makes codes longer and tree shaking harder to do and or slower

## To be done

- Eslint integration
- Task runner
